# GameRoulette

A simple yet effective way to settle down video game decisions with your friends.

A roulette made with HTML, CSS and a bit of JS magic. To customize the options, just change the _spinner_ div images. Option images work better if they are 128px x 128px.

Future support is planned for roulettes with 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8 options. 

## Demo
